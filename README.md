My Blog.

Practice React, all its nuances, and get a place to record my progress so far.

Let's Build! You got this.

Keep commenting on everything you do so that you can know exactly what something does when you 
come back to it later. 

Attention:

    I will use 'BrowserRouter' now because I am spending too much time fumbling around with
    'createBrowserRouter'. After I finish this with 'BrowserRouter' I will look into what really
    makes 'BrowserRouter' and 'createBrowserRouter' different and decide if it is worth it to
    refactor with 'createBrowserRouter'. I have to get over my hesitation to ask questions I may
    see as dumb and be okay with looking for help when I feel I have exhausted all other
    resources.

    Still not sure why I can import 'api' from './api/postsAxios.js' and refernce that server. 
    Worth looking into so I have an understanding as opposed to just following something I found to work.

Steps:

    0. Add button to switch between light and dark theme to the right side of the header.

    1. Add a feature that switches color themes when you click to a different page or reload the page.

    2. Since this is going to be a blog just for me to edit/post to, I should add authorized
    roles to the site. That way when I enter the site I will be able to post/edit whatever I
    want and other people will only be able to view my posts/whatever I allow.

    3. Keep commenting on all the different processes to hammer home what everything does.

    4. figure out how to deploy the site and set up proper backend. Probably easiest to use 
    firebase now but look up some tutorials on how different ways to make it work.

    5. I could maybe keeping the authorized role features, e.g creating, editing, and deleting posts, and assign a 
    dialog box to appear and chastize them if someone tries to click them who isn't authorized. Could have fun with 
    it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
