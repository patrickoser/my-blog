My Blog.

Practice React, all its nuances, and get a place to record my progress so far.

Let's Build! You got this.

Keep commenting on everything you do so that you can know exactly what something does when you 
come back to it later.

Attention:

    Think about using 'createRoutesFromElements' so you can keep the original syntax. You can always try using 'createBrowserRouter' on a later project once you find a good resource for how to format your code with it.

Steps:
    1. 

    3. Look into context api's/loaders for different ways to pass props to components. Prop drilling seems to still be
    possible with 'createBrowserRouter' I just havent figured out how to pass the props now that the router is a singleton
    and not nested with the 'App' component.

    4. Figure out Loaders, useEffect/useState when using 'createBrowserRouter'
    'createRoutesFromElements' in react router v6.4.

    5. Set up Axios to practice working with a database.

    6. Implement CRUD operations. 

    7. Create forms to post blogs.

Extras: 
    1. Since this is going to be a blog just for me to edit/post to, I should add authorized roles to the site. That way when I enter the site I will be able to post/edit whatever I want and other people will only be able to view my posts/whatever I allow.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
